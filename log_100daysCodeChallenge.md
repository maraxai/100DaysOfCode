### Day 1: May 8 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I start the challenge.

**Thoughts:** 	I takes a lot of time to prepare for the actual coding. Setup of twitter, codepen,  GitHub log.
				I dropped the idea to set up a codepen for every days exercises, it takes away from the coding. 
				Too much time is spent for writing everything down.
