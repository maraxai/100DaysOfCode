### Day 0: May 6 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I made the decision to take the challenge of logging 100 consecutive days of JavaScript coding for at least 1 hour per day. 

**Thoughts:** Excited about the outlook of my progress in the next 100 days.

**Link to work:** n/a


### Day 1: May 7 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Today I start the challenge.

**Thoughts:** 	I takes a lot of time to prepare for the actual coding. Setup of twitter, codepen,  GitHub log.
				I dropped the idea to set up a codepen for every days exercises, it takes away from the coding. 
				Too much time is spent for writing everything down.

### Day 2: May 8 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Tried to solve HackerRand exercise, in vain. 

**Thoughts:** 	feels unsatisfactory, spent one hour for an exercise and was not able to solve it 
				The problem is that I get an output of NaN instead of an integer; used parseInt() and map() without success

### Day 3: May 9 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Tried to solve HackerRand exercise, in vain. 

**Thoughts:** 	feels unsatisfactory, 
 		solved the 1st problem (tested in Chrome, with correct result) but HackeRand threw and error
		2nd problem: issue with reduce() / does not work in Chrome / reduce((a,b) => a - b);

### Day 4: May 10 2019 

**Today's Progress**: HackerRand exercise #2 of 30 Days Challenge and FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts:** 	feels unsatisfactory, 
				lost time, due to bug in HackerRand Day Operator Exercise

### Day 5: May 11 2019 

**Today's Progress**: HackerRand exercise #4 of 30 Days Challenge
 		  	FreeCodeCamp Factorialize (redo but happy that I was able to remember) 

**Thoughts:** 	too much documenting, too little coding

### Day 6: May 12 2019 

**Today's Progress**: HackerRand exercise #5 of 30 Days Challenge
 		  	redo FreeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting 1-4 

**Thoughts:** 	Repetition of exercises seems necessary, especially if several steps are involved
		e.g. Find The Longest Word in a String: involves 4 steps, i.e. split, map, sort and pop
